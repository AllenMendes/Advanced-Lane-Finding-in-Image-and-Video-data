## Overview

This project is an extension to my previous project [Finding Lane Lines in Image and Video](https://github.com/AllenMendes/Finding-Lane-Lines-in-Image-and-Video) in which I have added additional capabilities in the software pipeline like camera calibration and distortion removal from image and video input data, color and gradient thresholding, perspective transform, sliding window polynomial fitting algorithm to draw annoted curves/lines on lane lines and display useful information in the output video like Radius of curvature of the road and location of the vehicle with respect to the center of the lane. The above mentioned techniques help find determine lane lines most robustly and over a wider range of situations.

Detailed explaination of the code can be found in the [Writeup](https://github.com/AllenMendes/Advanced-Lane-Finding-in-Image-and-Video-data/blob/master/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines-P2/Writeup.md)
